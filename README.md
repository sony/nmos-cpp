## Introduction

This repository contains an implementation of the [AMWA Networked Media Open Specifications](https://specs.amwa.tv/nmos/) in C++, [licensed](LICENSE) under the terms of the Apache License 2.0.

- [AMWA IS-08 NMOS Audio Channel Mapping Specification](https://specs.amwa.tv/is-08/)
- [AMWA IS-09 NMOS System Parameters Specification](https://specs.amwa.tv/is-09/) (originally defined in JT-NM TR-1001-1:2018 Annex A)
- [AMWA BCP-002-01 NMOS Grouping Recommendations - Natural Grouping](https://specs.amwa.tv/bcp-002-01/)
- [AMWA BCP-003-01 Secure Communication in NMOS Systems](https://specs.amwa.tv/bcp-003-01/)

- The [nmos module](Development/nmos) includes implementations of the NMOS Node, Registration and Query APIs, the NMOS Connection API, and so on.
- The [nmos-cpp-registry application](Development/nmos-cpp-registry) provides a simple but functional instance of an NMOS Registration & Discovery System (RDS), utilising the nmos module.
- The [nmos-cpp-node application](Development/nmos-cpp-node) provides an example NMOS Node, also utilising the nmos module.

The [repository structure](Documents/Repository-Structure.md), and the [external dependencies](Documents/Dependencies.md), are outlined in the documentation.
Some information about the overall design of **nmos-cpp** is also included in the [architecture](Documents/Architecture.md) documentation.

### Getting Started With NMOS

The [Easy-NMOS](https://github.com/rhastie/easy-nmos) starter kit allows the user to launch a simple NMOS setup with minimal installation steps.
It relies on nmos-cpp to provide an NMOS Registry and a virtual NMOS Node in a Docker Compose network, along with the AMWA NMOS Testing Tool and supporting services.

### Getting Started For Developers

Easy-NMOS is also a great first way to explore the relationship between NMOS services before building nmos-cpp for yourself.

The codebase is intended to be portable, and the nmos-cpp [CMake project](Development/CMakeLists.txt) can be built on at least Linux, Windows and macOS.

After setting up the dependencies, follow these [instructions](Documents/Getting-Started.md) to build and install nmos-cpp on your platform, and run the test suite.

Next, try out the registry and node applications in the [tutorial](Documents/Tutorial.md).

An [nmos-cpp Conan package](https://conan.io/center/nmos-cpp) is published at Conan Center Index.

## Agile Development

[<img alt="JT-NM Tested 03/20 NMOS & TR-1001-1" src="Documents/images/jt-nm-tested-03-20-registry.png?raw=true" height="135" align="right"/>](https://jt-nm.org/jt-nm_tested/)

The nmos-cpp applications, like the NMOS Specifications, are intended to be always ready, but steadily developing.
They have been successfully tested in many AMWA Networked Media Incubator workshops, and are used as reference NMOS implementations in the [JT-NM Tested](https://jt-nm.org/jt-nm_tested/) programme.
Several vendors have deployed JT-NM Tested badged products, using nmos-cpp, to their customers.

### Build Status

The following configurations, defined by the [build-test](.github/workflows/src/build-test.yml) jobs, are built and unit tested automatically via continuous integration.
